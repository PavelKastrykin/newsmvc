'The proposals are aimed at staving off financial collapse and preventing a possible exit from the eurozone.
Eurozone finance ministers will examine the new proposals, which include pension cuts and tax rises, ahead of a full EU summit on Sunday.
Correspondents say Mr Tsipras''s new plan contains many elements rejected in a referendum last Sunday.
He is likely to face opposition from the left of his own Syriza party.
However, a parliamentary spokesman for Syriza, Nikos Filis, said he was confident parliament would give the government the mandate to negotiate the new bailout package.
The coalition government has 162 seats in the 300-strong parliament and also has the backing of many opposition MPs.',

'Mount Raung in East Java has been spewing ash into the air for nearly a week obscuring visibility at Bali''s Denpasar airport.
For a second day, many flights between Bali and Australia have been cancelled, stranding travellers.
The island is a top holiday destination for Australians.
A spokesperson for state airport operator Angkasa Pura told BBC Indonesian that Denpasar would be closed until at least 21:30 local time (13:30 GMT).
However Indonesian transport ministry official JA Barata said the re-opening of the airports would be based on Mount Raung''s activity.',

'Britain, France, Russia, China, the US and Germany - the P5+1 - group were hoping a deal by 04:00 GMT to ensure a speedy review by the US Congress.
However, US Secretary of State John Kerry said America and other major powers were not in a rush. Iran also expressed a similar position.
The sides seek to curb Iran''s programme in return for sanctions relief.
The pace at which sanctions will be lifted is a major issue at the negotiations.
The Friday morning deadline was set to meet the start a 30-day review period by the US Congress.
But now America''s lawmakers will have 60 days to examine any document, which will delay the lifting of US sanctions.
The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear weapons. Tehran says its programme is solely for peaceful purposes.',
